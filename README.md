# Advent of Code #

Welcome

Toplevel folders are for languages, inside each language dir they are divided by year to some extent.
I didn't want to define separate projects for each year basically.

Haskell code is based on Sam Coy's [template](https://github.com/samcoy3/advent-of-code-template). Also shamefully, those solutions are his trying to get the feel for the template and parser library used.

## TODO ##
Add a top-level nix-shell, so all the languages are available in each directory and I don't have to duplicate `shell.nix` && `nix/*`
